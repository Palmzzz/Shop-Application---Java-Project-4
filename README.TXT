My third project was to create a model of a ‘shop’
My shop sells one type of item which is always in stock. 

I needed to model a customer who interacts with the shop.
My customer can enter different shops and purchase items using their limited amount of money. 
My customer can enter multiple shops, but can only be in one at a time, and can only purchase items from the shop they are in.
 
Shops do not sell items for less than their price, so my customer needs to ensure they have sufficient money to make their purchase. 

I needed to think about how the state of the customer when not in *any* shop
I needed to think about how to incorporate them entering/exiting a shop without buying anything

I needed to incorporate each shop having a price for each item, as well as how many items were sold. 

I also needed to track the amount spent by the customer, as they are on a budget.
